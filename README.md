Getting Started (Local Setup)
-----------------------------

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

-   Node.js (v18+ recommended)

-   npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun

-   Docker (if running with containers)

### Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/echo-health.git
cd echo-health
```

### Install Dependencies

```
npm install  # or yarn install or pnpm install or bun install
```

### Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_DOMAIN=your-auth0-domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=your-auth0-client-secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
```

### Run the Development Server

```
npm run dev  # or yarn dev or pnpm dev or bun dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000> in your browser.

Running with Docker
-------------------

### Build the Docker Image

```
docker build -t echo-health .
```

### Run the Docker Container

```
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env.local echo-health
```

Now, open <http://localhost:3000> to see the app running inside Docker.

How to Add Features and Make Changes
------------------------------------

### Editing the UI

Modify `app/page.tsx` to update the home page. Changes auto-update in development mode.

### Adding New API Endpoints

API routes are in the `app/api/` directory. To add a new endpoint:

1.  Create a new folder inside `app/api/` (e.g., `app/api/patients`).

2.  Add a `route.ts` file inside the folder.

3.  Implement your API logic using Next.js API routes.

Example:

```
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export async function GET() {
    return NextResponse.json({ message: "Hello, Echo Health!" });
}
```
